Dear sir or madam.

From the beginning of the semester I paid a strong attention to Ryan because I felt that missing two classes (because of the Ireland game) was a situation that put him at a disadvantage to the rest of the group. My initiatives were to constantly offer him alternatives to catch up with practical class work, which is a fundamental element of language learning.   But these initiatives have not been successful. In addition to the two excused absences due to his work with the football team, he has missed four times without justification or prior notice. So far he has completed only one assignment. And frankly at this point I think he would have to make a big effort to pass the course, because although his level of Spanish is not bad, and his first quiz was ok, this is a course of many small assignments, and constant work, and in those aspects Ryan has not met the minimum requirements.
